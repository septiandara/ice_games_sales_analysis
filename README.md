This report was prepared for ICE, a video game marketplace, to analyse various characteristics of a video game (i.e. User and expert reviews, genres, platforms) and its effect on game sales. The goal is to identify the patterns that determine whether a game succeeds or not. This will allow ICE to spot potential big winners and plan advertising campaigns.

In this report you will find the analysis on the following:
1. Games sales based on year of release, genre and platforms.
2. Customer preference profile of each region (North America, Europe and Japan).
3. Hypotheses testing whether average user score on different platforms differs. 
4. Another hypotheses testing on whether selected genres differ in the average user score.

T-Test from Python Scipy was used to carry out the hypothesis tests.
